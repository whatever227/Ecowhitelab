      <h1>How does white pollution affect birds?</h1>
      <p>
      White pollution, primarily plastic debris, significantly harms birds
      through ingestion, entanglement, and habitat degradation. Birds may
      mistake plastic for food, causing digestive blockage, malnutrition, and
      starvation. Entanglement in plastic debris can lead to injury, drowning,
      or difficulty hunting. Additionally, plastic pollution can contaminate
        nests and affect the health of both adults and their young.</p>
      <h2>Detailed Impact:</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
        <li>
          Ingestion: <br />Birds can ingest plastic, mistaking it for food,
          which can lead to digestive blockages, starvation, and poisoning from
          chemicals in the plastic.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Entanglement: <br />Birds can become entangled in plastic bags,
          fishing line, and other debris, leading to injury, drowning, or
          difficulty in foraging.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Habitat Degradation: <br />Plastic pollution can contaminate nesting
          sites and food sources, impacting bird health and reproductive
          success.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Toxic Effects: <br />Some plastics contain chemicals that can be toxic
          to birds, leading to health problems or death.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Reduced Nest Building Materials: <br />Plastic debris can reduce the
          availability of natural nest-building materials, forcing birds to use
          less desirable or even harmful alternatives.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Misdirection: <br />Bright lights can attract birds during migration,
          leading to disorientation and collisions with buildings or other
          structures.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Increased Predation: <br />Plastic pollution can attract predators to
          areas with birds, increasing the risk of predation.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Noise Pollution: <br />Urban noise can mask birdsong, impacting
          communication and mating success.
        </li>
