    <h1>White pollution</h1>
    <h2>what is "white pollution"?</h2>
    <p>
      White pollution refers to the environmental damage caused by
      non-degradable plastic waste. It's a major concern due to the long-term
      effects of plastic on soil, water, and ecosystems, including harm to
      wildlife. It is a type of environmental pollution specifically caused by
      plastic waste, particularly items like plastic bags, bottles, and
      packaging.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it a problem?</h3>
    <p>
      Plastic waste is non-biodegradable, meaning it takes hundreds of years to
      break down. This leads to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Soil contamination: Plastic in landfills can leach chemicals into the
        soil and water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Water pollution: Plastic debris in oceans and waterways can be ingested
        by marine life, leading to their death.
      </li>
      <li>
        Air pollution: Burning plastic waste releases harmful greenhouse gases
        and toxins.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problem white pollution caused:</h3>

    <p>
      White pollution,leads to a multitude of environmental and health problems.
      These include harm to wildlife through entanglement and ingestion,
      pollution of water bodies and soil, and potential health issues for
      humans.
